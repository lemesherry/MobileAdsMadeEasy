###### Note: have a look into [documentation](https://github.com/lemesherry/MobileAdsMadeEasy/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation.md) to get to know how to use ads calling in your unity project.

###### Note2: This package uses newtonsoft-json library as a dependency for some json serialization, so if you have imported this package manually in your project you should not forget to also add newtonsoft-json library at-least v3.x.x.

###### Note3: A known issue: If in-case you are building project for Android then sometimes when you import google ads packge, the external dependency manager might throw an error saying "Assets/ExternalDependencyManager/Editor/1.2.176/Google.IOSResolver.dll' will not be loaded due to errors" since you are not building project for iOS, A simple solution for that would be to disable iOS resolver validate references by going to directory Assets/ExternalDependencyManager/versionNumber/Google.IOSResolver and then uncheck the box "Validate References" and hit apply, then it should be resolved. 

###### And that's it, unity will now automatically install dependencies and associated packages with it, and you can find the package contents inside "packages" folder in unity project root directory.
